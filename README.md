# Crystal Ball

A scratchpad for time series analysis in Scala.

Includes:

-   Common statistics libraries (TensorFlow, Breeze, etc.)

-   Charts (with live updates)

## Why not use notebooks?

I prefer using an IDE.

## Why not use python?

I prefer using Scala.

## Running on OSX

Simply run:

    ./run.sh

This will cause two processes to run in parallel:

    sbt ~run  # for your scala code
    npm start # for your live-updating charts
